### Description
Simple variational autoencoder trained on MNIST dataset. Create with use of PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. It is an implementation of model presented in paper [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114).

### Results
Reconstructions (left) and samples (right) from epoch with lowest error:
